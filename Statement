Eternity our One True Agreement
The piece Is about how in the end we all want a piece
Each image was created using quotes from one of four systems which are Atheism, Buddhism, Chhristianity and Hinduism that focused on Death, Enlightenment, Heaven and Moksha respectfully. 
These quotes personified that in the end everyone wants some form of finality with death, being the understood natural end, Enlightenment and Moksha worldly transcendence, and Heaven Paradise.
The differences come in mode as while everybody goes wantâ€™s peace the path to which has been clouded in vague understandings of what that entails rather then just accept that people fundamentally will never agree.
We should accept this vagueness as the only true agreement that we can reach that none of us truly know what is waiting for us only then the piece we seek can be attained.
